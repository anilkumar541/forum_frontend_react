# Online Forum Platform
The Online Forum Platform is a full-stack project built with Django and ReactJS, designed to facilitate knowledge-sharing and discussions. It allows users to create tags, post questions with detailed descriptions, and interact with answers by liking or disliking them. The platform features a robust user authentication system, ensuring only logged-in users can contribute content, while guests can freely explore. Real-time updates powered by WebSockets enhance user experience by instantly notifying active users about new questions. This project combines interactivity, scalability, and a focus on community engagement.
